To-Do-App

1.UX Design
Simple responsive design, tried to copy some of the basic looks from Grant Thornton site, colors and fonts. 
Bootstrap framework, mobile responsive. Some css transtions on the logo, if had more time would have like to have designed footer and spent longer on navbar. 

2.Technologies Employed
Bootstrap, MySQL, PHP, JQuery

3.Security
SQL database can be prone to hacking

4.Build and Deploy
Run locally using XAMPP. 
Open Xampp Control Panel and open PHPMyadmin.
You will need to upload the files 'database.sql' found in the main root of the folder and 'test_db.sql' found in the folder 'db'.
Database.sql stores info relating to list making app while test_db is for the login page.

5.Login Details
username - brian
password - 456

username - john
password - abc

6.Anything Extra
Given more time I would have styled the page more, header, footer.
